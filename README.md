# Video Project Name
Friendly Neighborhood

### Project Description
A short film follows Pavitr Prabhakar, the Spider-Man of Earth 1218B, resisting the mantle of Spider-Man. Pavitr lives in a world where superheroes are purely fictional entities, and yet he has great powers without wanting the great responsibilities. Pavitr eventually finds the motivation to help his Friendly Neighborhood, not as a superhero, but as just Pavitr.

### Process & Reflection
We wanted to make a film that could demonstrate some creative filming techniques to show off Spider-Man's powers and the troubles that might come with having the great powers without wanting the great responsibilities. Pavitr just wants to live a normal life in a world without superheroes, but resisting the mantle of Spider-Man slowly takes a toll on his life, impacting his work. That's the story we wanted to tell. Booking the equipment we needed was a big pain in the side because of how unreliable the arts booking portal is, but the actual filming, editing, and design work was all a lot of fun.
