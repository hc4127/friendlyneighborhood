          <p class="violetText pageText">The earliest stages of planning involved just two laptops and Google docs. We first discussed what we wanted: a nice little film where we could show off Spider-Man's powers through creative filming techniques. Then we had to decide what things were do-able. Web-shooters and weblines were immediately out of the question. We ended up deciding to emphasize on spider-sense and wall-crawling since those are most easily represented through clever camerawork. While planning we watched through hundreds of minutes of Spider-Man cinema, this gave us the idea to make a list of references we wanted to include. </p>

          <p class="violetText pageText">After the original brainstorming, the table of contents in the brainstorm doc slowly became scenes written using a semi-professional format. Everything from the narration to the character dialogue had to be written with the 6 minute time limit in mind. This meant changes of tone coudln't be too sudden and without reason. Things like music and inbetween-shots was not factored into the equation until post production but it greatly helped transition scenes that might seem too sudden during production or pre-production. </p>

          <p class="violetText pageText"> Production was easily the most difficult aspect of this filmaking journey. Between alligning schedules together between busy university students and having to reshoot scenes due to corrupt footage, everything about the actual filming was stressful. However, it was extremely satisying to watch back on the footage we shot during the day and put it into the cloud storage. Some of our favorite shots include the one where Pavitr walks up the wall of the dormitory, we hope you're curious as to how we did it because we think our technique was quite clever. Another scene we really liked filming was the getting up an ready sequence, we think it looks extremely good in post production with all the fast-cuts. </p>
